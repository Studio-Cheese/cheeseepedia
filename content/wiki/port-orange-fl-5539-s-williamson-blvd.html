<b><i>5539 S Williamson Blvd</b></i> was a Chuck E. Cheese's that opened on December 26, 2013, and closed on September 29, 2022, with a {{< wiki-link "Circles of Light" >}}. A new location is scheduled to be built on the site of the former location and will reopen in March, 2025, with the 2.0 remodel.
<h2>Stages</h2>
The store opened with a Circles of Light, 32m. The animatronic (which came from the {{< wiki-link "Dallas, TX (13364 Montfort Dr)" >}} location; removed in September 2012) had 16m legs and therefore no foot tap movement when it was installed, making it a {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese 32/16m Hybrid (Animatronic)" >}}.
<h2> History</h2>
A Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant had not existed in Volusia County, the Daytona Beach metro area, since the {{< wiki-link "Daytona Beach, FL (1300 W International Sp)" >}} location closed in 1983. When considering a new unit in the area, CEC Entertainment executives reviewed studies that claimed that the City of Port Orange was the fastest developing suburbia in Florida. Regardless of the much more sizeable population in Daytona Beach, CEC Entertainment elected to build a unit in Port Orange.
This location opened on December 26, 2013. An early Phase 5 store, it received Rockstar-era art but lots of Avenger-era regulatory signage, previously used equipment, and games.
The store was originally planned to open without an animatronic, but CEC Entertainment executives decided that it should have one given its proximity to Orlando and Disney World.
The store was located in the newly developed Port Orange Pavilion shopping center. Behind the Chuck E. Cheese's property is a playground and fountain area.
<h3> Hurricane Ian </h3>
On September 29, 2022, the ceiling of the location caved in and the exterior started to collapse. This was determined to be the result of insufficient drainage, causing a large pool of water to form on the roof during the heavy rainfall brought by Hurricane Ian. In addition, the interior had sustained extreme water damage. The location was considered unsalvageable and was promptly closed and demolished in October, 2022.
The location has since been rebuilt and is projected to reopen in March, 2025, on the existing property with the 2.0 remodel.
